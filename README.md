# Offline-TimeTable
Create nice time table 
table will tell you what lectures you have and will light up the lecture you have in the current time

the table written by html, css and js
so you can use the table on either your pc or your android, 

you can add the headers of the table you need, each separated by |
just make sure that day in the first position and start and finish time be exist

start and finish time must be on the form HH:MM

also make sure there is no empty lines

if you want to change the colors just add Colors.txt in the same folder of the program
and add four colors in html form

first color will be the background
second color will be the background of the headers and the font color of the lighted lecture
third will be the background of the lighted day
fourth will be the background of the lighted lectures

if the Colors txt is not exist when creating a table, will ask you to input the colors
so this method will work if you need to change the colors too
